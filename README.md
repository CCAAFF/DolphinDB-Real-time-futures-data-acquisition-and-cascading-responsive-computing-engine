# DolphinDB-Real-time-futures-data-acquisition-and-cascading-responsive-computing-engine

基于Simnow期货实时数据获得单档盘口的流数据，计算买卖压力差因子与结果回测实践案例展示。
代码获取需等图书发布后（或者现在联系作者小范围探讨）
此处代码为《AI驱动下的因子挖掘》一书中的部分代码，

Based on real-time data from Simnow futures, obtain flow data for single position positions, calculate buying and selling pressure differential factors, and present practical case studies for backtesting results.
Code acquisition needs to wait until the book is published (or contact the author now for a small-scale discussion)
The code here is a partial code from the book "Factor Mining Driven by AI",
